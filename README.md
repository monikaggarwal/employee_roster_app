# employee_roster_app
Generated a sample-data.json file in public folder by creating random functions in sample-data.js and initialized it with npm run setup as mentioned.
Successfully fetched and rendered data via app.js in a table structure on localhost.
Created the Employeemodal component for dialog box.
Implemented an onclick event for a dialog box; however, there is currently an error that I'm actively investigating.
